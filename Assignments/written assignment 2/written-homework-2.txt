CSCI 360-3

1) b

2) found in hex digits 11-16 of the PSW which is x'00001A'

3) condition code is last 2 bits of the 9th hex digit in the PSW. The 9th hex digit is X'A' or B'1010'. Last 2 bits of B'1010' is 10.

4) The instruction code length is the first 2 bits of the 9th hex digit in the PSW. The 9th hex digit is X'A' = B'1010'. First 2 bits of B'1010' are 10 which equals 4 bytes.

5) X'1A' - X'4' = X'16'

6) X'0006' is an S0C6 error which is called a Specification Exception

7) Summer used XL4 instead of F

8) should be this:

WRITTEN2 CSECT
         USING WRITTEN2,15  ESTABLISH A BASE REGISTER
         L     3,WINTER     LOAD A NUMBER INTO REGISTER 3
         L     4,SPRING     LOAD ANOTHER NUMBER INTO REGISTER 4
         AR    4,3          ADD THE TWO NUMBERS
         S     4,YETMORE    SUBTRACT YET ANOTHER NUMBER
         L     6,SIX        COPY SIX'S VALUE INTO REGISTER 6
         LR    4,6          STORE THE RESULT
         XDUMP AUTUMN,4     DUMP THE RESULT
         SR    7,7          SET REGISTER 7 = 0
         BCR   B'1111',14   RETURN TO CALLER
* THIS IS A COMMENT LINE.
NOTE     DC    CL2'OK'      PLACE KEEPER:  OKAY SO FAR
SIX      DC    F'6'         A CONSTANT = 6
WINTER   DC    F'211'       A NUMBER = 211
SPRING   DC    F'94'        ANOTHER NUMBER = 94
AUTUMN   DS    F            A PLACE TO PUT IT
YETMORE  DC    F'28'        YET ANOTHER NUMBER
         END   WRITTEN2     THE PROGRAM ENDS HERE

9) 211 + 94 - 28 = 277

10) the value of AUTUMN

11) literals have a default length of 1 byte vs fullwords which are 4 bytes

12) 'OK'

13) it throws the exception before it gets to XDUMP

14) 6

15) 0
